# finished-projects
These are my finished projects every line of code is labeled
for the pico fermi bagel games you need to have a .txt file called seceret log ( i reccomend the new version all the versions are labeled ) also if the game closes that means you won( i am currently working on it since it only closes if you open the file after you paste the code in for the first time then close and save it)
