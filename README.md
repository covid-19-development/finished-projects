# finished-projects
These are my finished projects every line of code is labeled
for the pico fermi bagel games you need to have a .txt file called seceret log ( i reccomend the new version all the versions are labeled ) also if the game closes that means you won( i am currently working on it since it only closes if you open the file after you paste the code in for the first time then close and save it)
all these files need modules installed the ones needed are at the top and to install go to command prompt and type"pip install (module name)". if 2 modules or more are needed then you perform the action multiple times but make sure you change the module name

for the auto emails .py please use the newest version and when you set it up instead of putting your password follow this tutorial below to get a less secure app password to use instead(if you put in your own password it wont work)
the autoclicker is aprox 10 clicks a second
